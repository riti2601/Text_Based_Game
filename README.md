- **Combat System:** Engage in turn-based combat with enemies, where you can attack, use health potions to heal, or attempt to flee.
- **Health Potions:** Collect health potions dropped by defeated enemies or use them strategically to heal during combat.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game dynamically adjusts enemy health and attack stats, providing a unique challenge with each playthrough.
