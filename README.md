# Text-Based Dungeon Game

Welcome to the Text-Based Dungeon Game! This is a simple console-based adventure game where players navigate through a dungeon, encountering enemies, fighting them, and trying to survive.

## Features

- **Randomized Enemies:** Encounter a variety of enemies such as Skeletons, Zombies, Warriors, Assassins, Knights, and Vampires, each with their own health and attack stats.
- **Combat System:** Engage in turn-based combat with enemies, where you can attack, use health potions to heal, or attempt to flee.
- **Health Potions:** Collect health potions dropped by defeated enemies or use them strategically to heal during combat.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game dynamically adjusts enemy health and attack stats, providing a unique challenge with each playthrough.
- **Game Over Conditions:** Lose all your health, and it's game over! But if you manage to defeat all enemies and exit the dungeon, you win!
